This folder contains the script files used to generate the experiment data included in Section 7.1 of the paper. Brief descriptions on the R files follow:

* ERM_Single_Asset_1.R: This script runs the optimal nested simulation experiment design for the single-asset ERM problem in Section 7.1 of the paper. It also generates Figure 1 & Figure 2 in Section 7.1 of the paper.
* ERM_Single_Asset_2.R: This script benchmarks the optimal nested simulation experiment design against other experiment designs; it produces Table 1 in Section 7.1 in the paper.
* NestedSim_ERM_Helpers.R: This file contains a collection of functions needed to construct the optimal nested simulation experiment design for the single asset ERM.
